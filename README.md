# 🦎 Global Unique Designs of Components

**A fusion of art and code – feel free to use any of them.**

This repository is a creative collection of generative and interactive cursor experiences built using **HTML5 Canvas** and **vanilla JavaScript**.  
Each folder contains a self-contained component or animation — including **tentacles**, **reptilian limbs**, **lizards**, and other fun procedural creatures.
